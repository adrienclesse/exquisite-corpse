    <p>She was living in a big castle in the middle of the forest. She had her room beautifully decorated with flowers. She always stared from the big window in the balcony and hoped to escape from this place.</p>
    <p>Every evening, once she got het pyjama on, a flower wilted. Oddly enough, it was one purple flower every time. never yellow, never red. One day the flowers stopped dieing. </p>
