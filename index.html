    So this one eye,cold bloeded girl has her hunger every single night.When it`s exactly midnight she has the urge to just eat anything she finds.What was her plan for this midnight ? Well she immediately opens her fridge and starts too eat all the icecubes were in her freezer.Getting warmer in her bed was just making her more hungry.Maybe being a coldbloeded was becoming a real her.Then one day she decided to move to Belgium and all her being warm problem dissaappeard.
