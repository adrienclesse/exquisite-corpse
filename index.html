<p>At noon the girl wandered through the streets looking for her daily dose of sunshine.</p>
<p>Her pockets were light but het head was lighter. While normally she lacks fortitude in the morning, this one had been different</p>
<p>Noon turned into an afternoon stroll that appeared to bring joy. It would be a promissing evening. Al she had to do was endure
    two more heavy hours under the watchfull eyes of her grandmother. </p>
    <p> If she didn't forget to give her the medication, all would be fine. Easy job, right?</p>
